  </header>
  <div>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> <em>Stay away from cheap USB-MIDI cables off the Internet!
Invest in a cable that is known to work correctly. See <a href="#known-to-work">below</a>
for some suggestions.</em> </p>
<p>We're dealing with legacy hardware here &mdash; the original POD was released
in 1998, POD 2.0 came in 2000 and PODxt came in 2002. While PODxt already
features a USB port, the only way to connect older PODs to your computer
is using MIDI cables. MIDI cables require a sound card with MIDI IN/OUT
ports, which not many hobbyist guitar players have.</p>
<p>Luckily, one can nowadays get a relatively cheap USB-MIDI cable. The problem
is, not all of them will work.</p>
<p>MIDI standard is not very complex and contains a variety of short messages,
such as Control Change <code>CC</code> messages, which are sent when you press or
release a key on the synthesizer or turn a knob on a POD or Program Change
<code>PC</code> messages, which are sent when you switch presets on a POD. For anything
more complex, System Exclusive <code>SysEx</code> messages are used. These are long
manufacturer-specific messages can are used to identify devices and
upload/download patches.</p>
<p>When buying cheap USB-MIDI cables off the Internet, please be aware that
there may be issues with the longer <code>SysEx</code> messages sending and receiving:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Data Loss: <code>SysEx</code> messages can be quite long and complex, and cheaper 
   USB-MIDI cables may not be able to reliably transmit all the data in
   the message. This can result in lost data or incomplete messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timing Issues: <code>SysEx</code> messages require precise timing to be properly
   received by the target device, and cheap USB-MIDI cables may not be
   able to reliably maintain the required timing accuracy. This can lead
   to errors or failed messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffer Overflow: Some MIDI devices have limited buffer sizes, and
   sending a large <code>SysEx</code> message can cause the buffer to overflow. Cheap
   USB-MIDI cables may have buffer overflow issues, leading to failed or.
   missing messages.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, sending <code>SysEx</code> messages using cheap USB-MIDI cables can
be problematic, and it is advisable to invest in a higher-quality cable
to ensure reliable and accurate data transfer.</p>
<p>When working with USB-MIDI cables, Windows users are generally advised to 
try the <code>winrt</code> build first as it uses a newer MIDI driver stack that is
in constant development and support and may work better in newer versions 
of Windows.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-known-to-work"><a name=known-to-work></a> What is known to work</h2>
<p>From my own experience and the experience of the pod-ui users, here are
some USB-MIDI cables that are known to work:</p>
<p><strong>M-Audio MIDISport Uno</strong> is a very affordable USB-MIDI cable, which
supports <code>SyxEx</code> message sending and works with all platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Bespeco BM100</strong> is another cheap USB-MIDI cable that is known to work.
Window users <strong>need</strong> to use the <code>winrt</code> build to get it working.</p>
<h2 id="what-may-work">What may work</h2>
<p>Here are some more options of good quality USB-MIDI cables that
the Interned agrees will support <code>SysEx</code> messages:</p>
<p><strong>Roland UM-ONE MK2</strong> is not the cheapest cable around, but is
widely regarded as one of the most reliable and stable options for
when SysEx messages are concerned.</p>
<p><strong>iConnectivity mio</strong> and <strong>mio XC</strong> are other examples of not so
cheap, but quality products that are reported to support <code>SysEx</code>
messages, MIDI Time Code <code>MTC</code> and other advanced MIDI features.</p>
<p><strong>Yamaha UX16</strong> is one of the pricier options, but it is known
to work reliably with <code>SysEx</code> messages.</p>
<p><strong>MOTU FastLane</strong> USB MIDI interface is not exactly a 1-to-1
USB-MIDI cable like the rest of the devices on the list, but for
the sake of completeness, it is worth to mention that is device
is known for  its low-latency performance and reliable <code>SysEx</code>
messaging capabilities.</p>
<p>Please also check <a href="https://www.vguitarforums.com/smf/index.php?topic=21480.0">this VGuitarForums post</a>
for more quality devices.</p>
<h2 id="what-doesnt-work">What doesn't work</h2>
<p class="center"><img alt="generic MIDI controller off AliExpress" src="https://arteme.github.io/pod-ui/images/usb-midi/chinese-usb-midi.png" /></p>
<p>The cheap generic cable you get off AliExpress that looks like this
doesn't work with <code>SysEx</code> messages. I know, because I have one.
The device identifies as <code>1a86:752d QinHeng Electronics CH345 MIDI adapter</code>.
Ironically, I bought it when I dusted off my POD 2.0 and started
working on pod-ui to not have to use an external USB sound card
with a proper MIDI cable. I've not been able to get it to transfer
<code>SysEx</code> messages on any platform, YMMV.</p>
<p>Frank Bu√ü has an excellent <a href="https://frank-buss.de/midi/">analysis</a>
of this device.</p>
<h2 id="bluetooth-midi-adapters">Bluetooth MIDI adapters</h2>
<p>Nowadays, there are plenty of wireless MIDI plugs that either
use Bluetooth or ad-hoc wireless communication with a dongle
you attach to a computer. Generally, these are more expensive
that the USB-MIDI cables.</p>
<p>I've not used any of these, but here is what the Internet has
to say. Please let me know if you've successfully used one
with a POD:</p>
<p><strong>M-Vave MS1</strong> is a very cheap device that is reported to
work with <code>SysEx</code> messages.</p>
<p><strong>Yamaha MD-BT01</strong> bluetooth MIDI adapter is supposed to support
<code>SysEx</code> messages.</p>
<p><strong>Roland WM-1</strong> bluetooth MIDI adapter is supposed to work
well. According to the manufacturer's website, you also need
a <code>WM-1D</code> dongle for Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Quicco Sound mi.1</strong> bluetooth MIDI adapter is supposed to
work.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-if-my-cable-doesnt-work-with-sysex">What can I do if my cable doesn't work with SysEx</h2>
<p>If the cable doesn't support <code>SysEx</code> messages, you won't be able
to auto-detect the device using pod-ui (or test the connection
in the settings dialog). You won't be able to get the list of
patches from the device, and you won't be able to store/retrieve
individual patches from the device.</p>
<p>You will still be able to switch presets and adjust individual
controls. Pod-ui will also react when you switch presets on
the POD or adjust controls on it.</p>  </div>
