title: How to Help?

If you like this project and would like to see it grow to support more devices
or add new features, consider helping out.

## Become a Tester

If you have a legacy Line6 device that is not currently supported, consider
reaching out, opening an issue at the [issues page](https://github.com/arteme/pod-ui/issues)
and becoming a tester for the project.

Initially, this involves connecting the device to your computer (Linux,
MacOS, Windows -- any platform would do), sending some MIDI messages and
collecting replies. The MIDI communication is pretty similar across
different POD devices, but there is usually something to figure out,
like the program data layout in the sysex messages or other device peculiarities.  

Once that is done, we'll make a beta version of the software that you
can test with your device. After a round of bug fixes, a new stable version
can be released.

## Lend Me Your Device

If you don't have the time to be a tester, consider the possibility
of sending me your device. It is usually faster if I have access to
the device myself and can test things locally.

Please let me know if it is possible for you to send your device to
Finland for testing, I will return the device once the software is
working.

## Donate Your Device

If you have a legacy device that you would like to donate for the
benefit of this project, but don't care to get it back, once it is
supported by pod-ui, please reach out. I gladly accept device
donations for the benefit of the project.

## Monetary Donations 

Currently I do not accept monetary donations. There are bureaucratic
details to figure out before I can do this...
